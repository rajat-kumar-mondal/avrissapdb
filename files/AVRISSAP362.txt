TH    Protonectin-F was found to be toxic to cancerous and non-cancerous cell lines. Specifically, Protonectin-F showed activity against MM96L cells, with a cytotoxic concentration (CC50) close to the concentration necessary to kill the correlated non-cancer cell HaCaT. The cytotoxic concentrations (CC50) of Protonectin-F were also more active toward HCT116, with a CC50 <10microM, and twice the concentration of Protonectin-F was necessary to kill the correlated non-cancer cell HEK293 (CC50 19microM).
