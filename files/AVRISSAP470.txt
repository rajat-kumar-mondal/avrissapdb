TH    Ranalexin alone caused hemolysis and toxicity to Vero cells at concentrations => 50 mg/L, whereas lysostaphin alone showed no hemolysis or toxicity. The combination of ranalexin and lysostaphin was no more toxic than ranalexin alone and demonstrated non-toxicity and minimal hemolytic activity at antibacterial concentrations.
