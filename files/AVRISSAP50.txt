IC    MIC = 16 microG/ML
TH    MP196 was only slightly hemolytic at high concentrations and not significantly cytotoxic to various human and animal cell lines, but it caused erythrocyte shrinking at 250microg/mL and severe morphological changes and lysis at 500microg/mL in murine red blood cells. In mice, intravenous doses of MP196 led to acute toxicity, including symptoms like excitement, indisposition, hind leg paralysis, and eventual death at higher concentrations.
