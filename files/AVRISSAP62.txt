TH    Melittin was evaluated for dermal toxicity on burned and normal skin at various time points (2, 24, 48, and 72 hours), showing no morphological changes in both test and normal groups. An in vivo hemolysis assay in mice revealed no hemolysis in the test groups compared to controls. These results indicate that melittin at the tested concentration did not cause dermal toxicity or hemolysis.
