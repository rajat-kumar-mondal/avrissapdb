TH    The cytotoxicity of analogues 1-18 was assessed using the MTT assay on WRL 68 and HepG2 cell lines. Lipidated depsipeptide analogues 4 and 6 were cytotoxic at higher concentrations, with analogue 6 being highly cytotoxic at 90 mg/mL. In contrast, amide analogue 14 exhibited much lower cytotoxicity at the same concentrations. Moreover, None of the amide analogues 14-17 nor the linear peptide 18 showed hemolytic activity at concentrations eight times the MIC, indicating that ring opening due to ester bond hydrolysis is not responsible for hemolysis.
