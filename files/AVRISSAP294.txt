TH    Daptomycin has demonstrated a favorable safety profile in both animal toxicology studies and clinical trials, including a Phase I trial assessing its tolerability and pharmacokinetics in hemodialysis patients with end-stage renal disease. Daptomycin also can cause dose-dependent hemolysis, especially in patients with renal impairment or on high doses, necessitating monitoring for anemia or hemoglobin changes during therapy.
