TH    Nal-P-113, a peptide with bulky hydrophobic side chains, exhibited increased cell toxicity and hemolytic activity at higher concentrations (> 25 microG/mL), causing 10-20% cell death and hemolysis. This was in comparison to controls, indicating a potential concern for toxicity at elevated doses.
