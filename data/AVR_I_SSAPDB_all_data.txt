TH    Melittin was evaluated for dermal toxicity on burned and normal skin at various time points (2, 24, 48, and 72 hours), showing no morphological changes in both test and normal groups. An in vivo hemolysis assay in mice revealed no hemolysis in the test groups compared to controls. These results indicate that melittin at the tested concentration did not cause dermal toxicity or hemolysis.

TH    Daptomycin has demonstrated a favorable safety profile in both animal toxicology studies and clinical trials, including a Phase I trial assessing its tolerability and pharmacokinetics in hemodialysis patients with end-stage renal disease. Daptomycin also can cause dose-dependent hemolysis, especially in patients with renal impairment or on high doses, necessitating monitoring for anemia or hemoglobin changes during therapy.

TH    Depsipeptides 6, 8, and 11 showed hemolytic activity at higher concentrations, correlating with their hydrophobicity, while amide analogues 14ï¿½16 had no appreciable hemolytic activity. DMSO presence in the assay may enhance hemolysis due to potential peptide aggregation at higher concentrations. Depsipeptides 4 and 6 were cytotoxic to WRL 68 and HepG2 cell lines at higher concentrations, unlike amide analogue 14, which exhibited much lower cytotoxicity. The lack of cytotoxicity in amide analogue 14 is likely due to its conformational differences and lower hydrophobicity compared to the depsipeptides.

TH    The cytotoxicity of analogues 1-18 was assessed using the MTT assay on WRL 68 and HepG2 cell lines. Lipidated depsipeptide analogues 4 and 6 were cytotoxic at higher concentrations, with analogue 6 being highly cytotoxic at 90 mg/mL. In contrast, amide analogue 14 exhibited much lower cytotoxicity at the same concentrations. Moreover, None of the amide analogues 14-17 nor the linear peptide 18 showed hemolytic activity at concentrations eight times the MIC, indicating that ring opening due to ester bond hydrolysis is not responsible for hemolysis.
